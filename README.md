Project: Predict Sales Revenue with Simple Linear Regression
In this project a simple linear regression model is built and evaluated using Python.The scikit-learn module  is employed for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting.Data to be be working with will be a very popular Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper.This project ends with explaining the core ideas of linear regression to technical and non-technical audiences, building a simple linear regression model in Python with scikit-learn, employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to small data sets with seaborn and pandas, and evaluate a simple linear regression model using appropriate metrics.
