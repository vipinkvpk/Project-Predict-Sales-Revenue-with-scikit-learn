# Project-Predict-Sales-Revenue-with-scikit-learn
Project: Predict Sales Revenue with Simple Linear Regression
In this project-based course, you will build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using Python. You will employ the scikit-learn module for calculating the linear regression, while using pandas for data management, and seaborn for plotting. You will be working with the very popular Advertising data set to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through mediums such as TV, radio, and newspaper. By the end of this project, you will be able explain the core ideas of linear regression to technical and non-technical audiences, build a simple linear regression model in Python with scikit-learn, employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to small data sets with seaborn and pandas, and evaluate a simple linear regression model using appropriate metrics.
